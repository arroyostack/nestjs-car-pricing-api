## Description

This repository serves as a tutorial for working with Nest.js, focusing on building a used car pricing API.

### Application Overview

This API will help users estimate the value of their cars based on factors like make, model, year, and mileage.

### Project Features

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up with email and password to access the application.
2. **Car Valuation**: Once logged in, users can get an estimate of their car's value based on its details.
3. **Reporting Sales**: Users can report their car sales, providing the actual dollar amount they sold their car for.
4. **Administrator Approval**: Administrator users review reported sales before adding them to the dataset to prevent abuse.

### Project Architecture

The application's architecture will be designed to handle user authentication, car valuation, reporting sales, and administrator approval. Though the application's flow may seem straightforward, various side features need to be implemented.

### Next Steps

In the upcoming videos, we'll delve into the high-level architecture of our application and start implementing the necessary features.

### Tutorial Progress

- We've outlined the features and architecture of our application.
- Next, we'll investigate high-level architecture in the following video.

Stay tuned for updates and further progress in the tutorial!
